                        <p>On my third semester (Front End) we had to make a protoype for the company Advice. They
                            wanted a website they could show clients their carbon footprint. For this we used an API key
                            and endpoint for storage of the data in our own datasystem. The project is not responsive,
                            so works only on desktop. It is programmed so its possible to type any URL, but since the
                            API gave everyones projects problems, it was decided to use a stored URL and data. For this
                            it is Facebook.

                        <p>For this exam project we had to find a client (start-up) and rebrand their website. Our
                            client was the wine bar Pompette. We used Wordpress for the primary styling and css for the
                            dynamic content.

                        <h3>Xd prototype and stilpitch</h3>

                        <p>On my first semester we had to design a prototype for a webshop that sells t-shirts. We had
                            to come up with our own concept, create a tagline, find a USP and create microcopy to stand
                            out for competitors. My concept was to create a platform for local artists to sell their art
                            on a printed t-shirt. To stand out for other like minded companies, the idea was to have one
                            artist to sell 5 printed t-shirts every month and the website would be designed so it was
                            fitted to the artist. For the prototype I used my own art and prints I have been selling
                            myself.

                        <p>On my first semester I had to develop a resposnive website with a game. All the illustrations
                            and character design is designed by me in Illustrator. For the visuals we had to draw
                            inspirations from other game designs and I chose to take inspiration from ThatGameCompany.
                            The game had to be a simple click game with good and bad elements and a point system.

                        <p>On my first semester we had to <strong>redesign a website</strong>, and our group chose the
                            secondhand store NOMADS as client. We had to redesign the user interface, photostyle
                            (product photos) and make a videoproduction presenting the client. The method used for this
                            assignment was the Double-Diamond method and prototype testing.
